	<div id = "textblock"><center><br>My name is DJ Greg, and I am currently attending Los Altos High School. I moved from Newton, Massachusetts in the summer of 2015 and DJaying is one of my many hobbies. I love working with kids, and I have worked as a counselor at Bald Eagle Sports Camps for two years. I have been a DJ for two years, DJing Father/Daughter Dances, Walkathons, School Dances, Birthdays, and other events in the Bay Area.</div></center>
